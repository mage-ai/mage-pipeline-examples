## Superhero data analysis pipeline tutorial

### Overview
In this tutorial, we'll build a data pipeline that fetches superhero data, processes their power statistics, and analyzes them using SQLite. The pipeline demonstrates ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) principles using Mage.ai.

<br />

### What you'll learn
- How to fetch data from a REST API
- Data transformation with Pandas
- Working with SQLite in Python
- Performing statistical analysis on nested JSON data
- Joining data using SQL

<br />

### Pipeline steps
1. **Data loading**: Fetch superhero data from the superhero-api
2. **Data transformation**: Extract and analyze power statistics
3. **Data storage**: Save processed data to SQLite
4. **Data analysis**: Join and query the results

<br />

### Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of SQL
- Familiarity with Pandas
- Mage.ai installed and configured

<br />

### Expected output
The final dataset will contain:
- Basic superhero information
- Individual power statistics (intelligence, strength, etc.)
- Statistical analysis (mean, max, min, median) for each power attribute
- Combined view through SQL joins

<br />

Let's get started with the implementation...
