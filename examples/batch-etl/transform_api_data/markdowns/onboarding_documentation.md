## Data loader block

Welcome the Data Loader block, the gateway that breathes life into your data pipeline by summoning data from distant realmsâ€”like an API.

#### How it works:

**Function Setup**: The load_data_from_api function is enchanted with the @data_loader decorator. This magic mark designates it as the guardian that brings data into your pipeline.

**Fetching Data**: With a wave of its wand, the function sends a GET request to the specified URL, inviting the CSV data to join your journey.

**Loading Data**: The summoned text data is gracefully transformed into a pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv, preparing it for the adventures that lie ahead in your pipeline.

#### Purpose:










------------------






This block is the catalyst that ignites your pipeline by extracting essential data directly from the API. It orchestrates the connection and retrieval of data ensuring the data entering your pipeline is pure and well-structured. With this foundation, the rest of your pipeline can work its magic.
